# soc225finalproject: Social Vulnerability

<h2> Introduction </h2>

When disasters occur, some communities experience worse effects and face greater struggles
in recovering (CDC, 2020). One way of measuring a community’s ability to withstand hardship 
is by their social vulnerability. Issues that impactsocial vulnerability can be economic, 
demographic, or resource-related (CDC, 2020). This concept of social vulnerabilitycan apply 
to individuals, as well. In particular, some people are more vulnerable to experiencing 
homelessness, and homelessness also renders a person especially vulnerable to both the elements 
and to further hardship. It is already well-documented that homelessness is impacted by poverty
and housing shortages (Williams, 2017). According to Williams, homelessness is impacted by a 
lack of affordable housing, as “housing supply has not kept pace with the numbers of people
whose incomes require low cost housing if they are to remain stably housed, putting them at 
severe risk for homelessness(2017).” This project looks at the intersection of housing and 
other measures of social vulnerability, particularly crowded housing. The CDC’s social 
vulnerability index defines crowding as the number of occupied household units with more 
people than rooms (2020). My research question is: how do living conditions relate to other
measures of social vulnerability? Are counties with a higher level of crowded living also 
poorer? Do states with larger homeless populations also have high levels of crowding?
